Do you ever think about the steps that you follow when start a pentesting? Probably you start performing some OSINT tasks to gather public information about the target. Then, maybe you run hosts discovery and ports enumeration tools. When you know what the target exposes, you can execute more specific tools for each service, to get more information and maybe, some vulnerabilities. And finally, if you find the needed information, you will look for a public exploit to get you into the target machine. I know, I know, this is an utopic scenario, and in the most cases the vulnerabilities are found due to the pentester skills and not by scanning tools. But before using your skills, how many time do you spend trying to get as information as possible with hacking tools? Probably, too much.

With Rekono, you can design your pentesting processes including the hacking tools that you need to combine, and then you can execute it directly against your target. While the full process is running, you can see the result of each tool execution and Rekono will send you notifications with the findings. So you will have the target information instantly and you can focus in find vulnerabilities on your own using your skills, while Rekono executes the boring and predictable part of the pentesting. Of course, you can review your findings in the platform and Rekono includes a Defect-Dojo integration, so if you need an advance vulnerability management you can import them in your Defect-Dojo instance.

Oh, one more thing, you can execute the entire process from anywhere using the Rekono Telegram bot.
